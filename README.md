# bulldozer-regression

This is a project that was completed as part of the course, "Complete Machine Learning & Data Science Bootcamp 2023" by Andrei Neagoie & Daniel Bourke.

The purpose of this project is to use ML tools (regression) to go through an example project that adresses this question: How well can we predict the price of a bulldozer given its characteristics and examples of previous prices?
